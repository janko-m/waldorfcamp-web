With Lidija, we practice yoga to find again our inner peace that connects us to
the universal energy and opens us to love. It is easier to achieve this on Olib
because the energy of friendship we cherish for years helps us. We practice in
the morning in a pine forest, listening to the waves. The physical exercises
strengthen and relax your body, while the breathing exercises activate our
vital energy. Through the practice of meditation you will learn to focus your
mind in order to perceive the "self", achieve a clearer mind, improve your
concentration, and discover the wisdom and tranquility within you. The power of
yoga healing will increase your memory power, enthusiasm, and positive approach
to life.
