We practice yoga to find again our inner peace that connects us to the
universal energy and opens us to love.

It is easier to achieve this on Olib because the energy of friendship we
cherish for years helps us. And, we are on a summer holiday, and we let our
soul to be more playful. It's a good balance against the rational, logical mind
which dominates in our daily life.

We practice in the morning in a pine forest, listening to the waves. The
physical exercises strengthen and relax the body. The breathing exercises
activate our vital energy, and the concentration exercises and meditation
connect us with our intuitive nature. We feel ourselves and the nature more
fully and we are more open for communication with each others.

Yoga lessons are lead by Lidija Georgieva, who is the owner and manager of her
