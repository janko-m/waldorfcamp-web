We will have a lot of fun practicing circus skills like, acrobatics, juggling,
balancing, clowning and a few magic tricks. After trying everything they want,
the kids has to choose a few elements to practice. We want also to make a nice
performance at the end.

Acrobatics: rolls, standing on head and hands, wheel, lots of positions
standing on eachother and building easy pyramids.

Juggling: with scarfs, balls, playing diabolo, spinning the plate, throuing
rings, playing flowerstick.

Balancing: balance ball, rolla-bolla, slack-line, unicycle.

Clown: some short and funny sequences for children.

Magic: a few tricks with acting parts.
