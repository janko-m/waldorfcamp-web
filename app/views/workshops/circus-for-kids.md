# Circus for kids

![Children doing circus](/assets/workshops/circus-for-kids.jpg)

We will have a lot of fun practicing circus skills like acrobatics, juggling,
balancing, clowning and a few magic tricks. After trying everything they want,
the kids will choose a few elements to practice with. Then, at the end, we would
like to make a nice performance.

**Acrobatics**: rolls, standing on the head and hands, wheel, lots of positions
standing on eachother and building easy pyramids...

**Juggling**: with scarfs, balls, playing diabolo, spinning the plate, throwing
rings, playing flowerstick...

**Balancing**: balance ball, rolla-bolla, slack-line, unicycle...

**Clown**: some short and funny sequences for children.

**Magic**: a few tricks with acting parts.
