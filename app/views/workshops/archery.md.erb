# Archery

![A kid shooting an arrow](<%= image_path "workshops/archery.jpg" %>)

This workshop gives you the opportunity to learn one of the techniques of
traditional archery. We will practice with hungarian [magyar
bows](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Composite_bow#Hungarian_bow) and arrows. This
practice makes it easier to concentrate and relax and to find the middle point
between up and down and right and left. It can be a kind of meditation if we
make slow and integral movements.

Our art of target will take the name of intuitive target. For the children we
will change our shooting position and put some different things on the target.

**Time**: 2 × ½ hours

**Price**: €10 for children, €20 for adults
