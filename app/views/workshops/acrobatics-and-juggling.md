In the first part of this workshop we will practice some general physical
movements. Then we will start practicing acrobatics from the basic exercices to
more dificult ones, depending on how we feel and how well we prepare our bodies
â€“ the muscles need to learn to be in tension at the right moment and to find the
balance between different movements.

On the juggling exercises we will pay attention to the rhythm and practice
throwing and catching elements at individual and collective figures.
