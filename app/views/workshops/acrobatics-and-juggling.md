The first part of this unit will be dedicatet to some general fisical
movements.

Practicing acrobatics from the basic exercices until maybe more dificult ones,
we are feeling and tuning our body, the muscles learn to be in tension at the
right moment and finding the balance between different movements.

At the juggling exercises we care about the rythm and practice throwing and
catching elements  at individual and collective figures.
