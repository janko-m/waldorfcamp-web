# Arts & Crafts

![Peter painting](<%= image_path "workshops/arts-and-crafts.jpg" %>)

Petar will never teach you how to move you brush or take care about
perspective, but he will definitely discover a real and hidden artist in you!
Painting with acrylic colors will help you to learn about shadows, colors,
volume, light, realistic and abstract style, working from both observation and
imagination. Also you will create art by combining different materials
collected around us (at the beaches!) and transformed into art by our
imagination, freedom and joy! Since Petar plans to vary different art media,
maybe you will learn about the medium of clay, how to use it artistically, and
the exciting possibilities it holds for us. Petar's workshops always focus on
process rather than “perfect” results.

Even though we will supply painting easels, palletes, colors and different
canvas formats, attendants can also bring their own equipment for other
artistic techniques. We will observe the paintings each day to help attendants
develop new possibilities for their paintings. After the first week attendants
should come up with a general idea about the style, motif and feel of their
paintings. During the last few days, they can submit their paintings to the
gallery for everyone to enjoy.
